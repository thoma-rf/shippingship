It was a clear night. You lined up with some other people at the port.
Waiting for the ship to be harbored on the pier.

As little later after the ship harbored. 
A big distinguished man came out from the big vessel.
Walking assertively, and suddenly stopped in front of you.

[Man]: So, you're the new recruit. 
I am Captain Pol. 
Before we continue, please tell me your name.

Name? (First Last)
>

[Pol]: do you know what the job is?
1) I know, that's why I'm here.   >  [Pol]: Good, so you know what we do. 
2) I don't know, I just need a job.  
> 

[Pol]: We hunt cryptids. Creatures of the night. You better firm your buckle.


[Pol]: Can you fight?
1) I can use sword.
2) I can shoot arrow.

[Pol]: Alright, that is good flair.
You are now part of the Night Walker. Welcome abroad, bud.


Pol then instructed the crew to enter the ship, and shortly after the ship set off.
